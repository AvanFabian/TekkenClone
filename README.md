## <a name="description">🎮 Description</a>
Pendekar Kebenaran is a thrilling 3D fighting game that draws inspiration from classic arcade brawlers, bringing fast-paced action, strategic combat, and dynamic animations to life. Players can choose from a roster of diverse fighters, each with unique attack animations, combos, and special abilities. With smooth controls, intense battles, and immersive visuals, Pendekar Kebenaran challenges players to master precise timing, unleash devastating ultimate moves, and outsmart opponents in a variety of combat scenarios. Whether battling AI or facing friends, every match is a test of skill, reflexes, and strategy.

## <a name="features">🎯 Game Features</a>
- Diverse Fighters and Combos: Choose from unique characters with distinct combat styles and perform light, medium, and heavy attack combos to dominate your opponents.
- Ultimate Skill System: Charge your Ultimate Gauge through successful attacks and unleash powerful Ultimate Moves that deal massive damage and stun enemies.
- Dynamic AI and Difficulty Modes: Face adaptive AI opponents across Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty settings, with behaviors that include dodging, retreating, and aggressive attacks.

## <a name="gameplaymechanics">🔗 Gameplay Mechanics</a>
1. Combo-Based Attack System: Players can execute a variety of attacks by pressing combinations of buttons (1, 2, 3, and 4) to perform light, medium, and heavy attacks. Each character has unique animations and combos that can be chained together to deal more damage.
2. Ultimate Attack System: By landing successful hits, players charge their Ultimate Gauge. Once full, players can unleash a powerful "Ultimate Attack" with the Q button, dealing massive damage and stunning opponents temporarily, preventing them from attacking.
3. Dodge and Movement System: Players can use the E button to perform a quick dodge, allowing them to evade enemy attacks. A cooldown prevents the dodge from being spammed, requiring players to time their movements strategically.
4. Dynamic AI Opponents: AI opponents adapt their combat behavior based on difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard). They can attack, dodge, retreat when low on health, and perform special moves, ensuring each battle is challenging and unpredictable.

## <a name="knownissues">❌ Known Issues</a>
1. Limited Fighter Roster: The current game lacks a variety of characters, limiting player options and replayability. Expanding the roster with unique fighters could enhance the gameplay experience.
2. Basic Combat Mechanics: While combo and ultimate systems exist, advanced combat mechanics like grabs, counters, or environmental interactions are not yet implemented.
3. Player Attack Bugs: While performing attacks, the player can hit enemies even when not facing them closely or properly aligned. This results in unrealistic combat interactions where attacks register damage despite improper positioning or distance.
4. Lack of Multiplayer Mode: The game currently focuses on single-player battles, missing an online or local multiplayer mode that would make it more engaging for competitive play.
5. Simple AI Behavior: Although AI opponents adapt to difficulty settings, their combat patterns can become predictable over time, reducing the challenge for skilled players.
6. Limited Visual and Audio Diversity: The game lacks diverse visual environments, animations, and sound effects, making extended gameplay feel repetitive without additional content like new stages or effects.
